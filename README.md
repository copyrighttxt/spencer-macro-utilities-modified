# Spencer Macro Client (fork)

this is a fork from spencers macro utilities (https://github.com/Spencer0187/Spencer-Macro-Utilities) with added customization, a new modern ui, stuff like that.

An open-source Windows C++ Roblox ImGui Macro with many features.

To Compile, run the project in Visual Studio 2022 and build it. The main source code is located inside of Visual Studio/macroframework.cpp.

### Is this A CHEAT???
No, it's a macro, it doesn't communicate with Roblox memory in any way.

### Known Issues
If you get "0x0" or any other key immediately when binding, restart your PC.

If you get DLL errors when launching, install [The Visual Studio 2022 x64 C++ Redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

If it doesn't launch at all, go into properties and select "Unblock" on the file.

If you have another issue where keybinds don't work, restart your computer, it seems to fix it permanently.

In certain scenarios, when downgrading from a version with more features to a version with less features causes the program to crash on launch, either delete your RMCsettings.json file, or remove section_order_vector from the .json.
